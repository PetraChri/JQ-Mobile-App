# JQ-Mobile-App

Author - Petra Chrisostomakis

Description -
This project is an application in wich a user can find 10 step tutorials about various things. The one that I programmed
is a step tutorial on braiding your hair. The notion is basically giving simple steps and tips on how to do things.

Instructions -
When the user opens the app he is directed into the main page wich has the title and the start button. From then he can choose to begin
the days tutorial or visit other tutorials through the footer menu. The footer menu is always stationary making navigation easy and 
the user can go through the home, favorites, and other lists buttons. Once he has begun one of the tutorials he can then
move forward or back through steps as well as just leave. If the user chooses to leave mid way of the tutorial the app will remember 
at which step the user took off if he clicks to go back on again.
